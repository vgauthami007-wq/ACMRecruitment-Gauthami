Errors we found

Hardcoded Initial Values:
Using -9999999 for largest and second is unsafe.
If all numbers in the list are smaller than -9999999, it fails.

Duplicates Not Handled Properly:
The function considers a duplicate of the largest number as the second largest.
Example: [5, 5, 5] incorrectly returns 5 as the second largest.

Missing Edge Case Check:
If the list has fewer than two unique numbers, the function should not return a result.
