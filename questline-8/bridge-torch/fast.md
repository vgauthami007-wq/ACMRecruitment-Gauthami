To find the fastest time for all four people to cross the bridge, follow these steps.
Let the two ends of the bridge be X and Y, and the four people be labeled by the time they take to cross: 1, 2, 7, and 10 minutes.

Step 1: Persons 1 and 2 cross from X to Y with the torch. Time taken = 2 minutes.

Step 2: Person 1 returns with the torch to X. Time taken = 1 minute.

Step 3: Persons 7 and 10 cross from X to Y with the torch. Time taken = 10 minutes.

Step 4: Person 2 returns from Y to X with the torch. Time taken = 2 minutes.

Step 5: Finally, persons 1 and 2 cross together from X to Y. Time taken = 2 minutes.

Total time = 2 + 1 + 10 + 2 + 2 = 17 minutes.
