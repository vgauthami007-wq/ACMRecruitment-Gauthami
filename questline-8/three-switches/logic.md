I can figure out which switch controls the bulb by using the bulb’s heat. First, I will go to the room with the switches and turn Switch 1 on for about 10–15 minutes. If Switch 1 is connected to the bulb, the bulb will become warm. After 15 minutes, I’ll turn Switch 1 off and immediately turn Switch 2 on, leaving Switch 3 off. Then I will quickly enter the bulb’s room to check:

If the bulb is glowing, it is controlled by Switch 2.

If the bulb is off but still warm, it is controlled by Switch 1.

If the bulb is off and cold, it is controlled by Switch 3.
