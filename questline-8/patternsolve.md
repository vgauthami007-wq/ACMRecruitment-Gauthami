The sequence given is 2, 6, 12, 20, …
The differences between consecutive terms are 4, 6, 8, …, which increase by 2 each time.
Therefore, the difference sequence continues as 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, …

Using this pattern:

Adding 10 to 20 gives 30

Adding 12 to 30 gives 42

Hence, the next two terms of the sequence are 30 and 42.
