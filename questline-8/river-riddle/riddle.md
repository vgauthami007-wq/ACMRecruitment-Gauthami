Let the two riverbanks be Bank 1 and Bank 2.
Initially, the farmer, goat, cabbage, and wolf are all on Bank 1.

The farmer takes the goat to Bank 2 (leaving the wolf and cabbage on Bank 1).

The farmer returns to Bank 1, then takes the cabbage to Bank 2. To avoid leaving the goat and cabbage together, he brings the goat back to Bank 1.

The farmer leaves the goat on Bank 1 and takes the wolf to Bank 2 (so now the wolf and cabbage are on Bank 2).

The farmer goes back alone to Bank 1.

Finally, the farmer takes the goat to Bank 2.

Now, the farmer has successfully transported the wolf, goat, and cabbage across the river.
