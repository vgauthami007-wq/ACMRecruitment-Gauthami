I have chosen **Bubble Sort** to sort the array [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6].

Bubble Sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms.  
It works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.  
Although not the most efficient (O(n²)), it’s easy to understand and implement.

Input: [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]  
Output: [1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]
